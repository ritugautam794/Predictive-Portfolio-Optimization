# Predictive-Portfolio-Optimization

## Introduction
This project aims to construct and manage a multi-asset portfolio using advanced machine-learning techniques to predict and select top-performing stocks. The focus is on optimizing the equity portion of the portfolio by leveraging historical financial data and predictive models to identify potential future winners in the stock market.

## Data Collection and Integration

Streamlining Data Sources to Build One Comprehensive Dataset for ML Model Input

1. Exploring Data Sources
In the quest to construct a robust predictive model, a critical first step is to gather and integrate diverse datasets that can offer insights into stock performance. Our approach involves collecting a variety of financial and market data from reliable sources such as Yahoo Finance. The key data components include:

Company Financial Ratios: These ratios, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), return on equity (ROE), and debt-to-equity (D/E), provide insight into a company's financial health and operational efficiency.

Sector Information: Understanding the sector classification of each stock allows us to analyze industry trends and sector-specific dynamics, which can influence stock performance.

Market Capitalization Data: Market cap is a key indicator of a company's size and market value, affecting investment strategies and risk assessment.

Stock Returns Data: Historical stock returns are crucial for analyzing past performance and estimating future price movements.
